metric established (normalized to minimize): ((1.00*[RF0](COST-TRAVEL)) - () + 0.00)

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is ((1.00*[RF0](COST-TRAVEL)) - () + 0.00)

advancing to distance:    4
                          3

best first search space empty! problem proven unsolvable.
